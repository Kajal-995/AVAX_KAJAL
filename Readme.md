### AvaxTest Smart Contract
This is a simple Solidity smart contract called AvaxTest that demonstrates the usage of require, assert, and revert statements in Ethereum and Avalanche (AVAX) smart contracts. These statements are crucial for ensuring the correctness and security of your smart contracts. Below, we'll explain how each of these functions works and provide examples of their usage.

## Introduction

The AvaxTest contract is a basic example of a smart contract deployed on the Avalanche blockchain. It contains three functions: testRequire, testAssert, and testRevert. These functions illustrate the different ways you can handle conditions and errors within your smart contracts.

## Requirements

- Solidity ^0.8.0
- An Avalanche (AVAX) development environment

## Usage

### testRequire

The testRequire function uses the require statement to check if the input x is greater than 10. If this condition is not met, the function will revert with an error message. Otherwise, it will set the num state variable to the value of x.

```solidity
function testRequire(uint256 x) public {
    require (x > 10, "X should be greater than 10");
    num = x;
}
```
## testAssert
The testAssert function uses the assert statement to assert that the input x is greater than 5. If this condition is not met, it will trigger a runtime exception, effectively reverting any changes made to the contract state.

solidity
```
function testAssert(uint256 x) public {
    assert (x > 5);
    num = x;
}
```

## testRevert
The testRevert function demonstrates the use of revert without a condition. It checks if x is greater than 15 and, if it is, reverts with a custom error message. Otherwise, it proceeds without any issues.

solidity
```
function testRevert(uint256 x) public pure {
    if (x > 15) {
        revert("The value of x is greater than 15");
    }
}
```
